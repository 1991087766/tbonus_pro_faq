Introduction of integral Tfil and Stablecoin MetaCoin

The creation of Metacoin comes from a need for the construction of virtual world economic system in the new era. In the future, the most valuable encrypted assets (virtual assets) will be created in the Metaverse. The assets will exist in the form of NFT and the currency will exist in the form of Token (Platform Coin/WGRT (WaykiChain Governance Coin)). Asset management requires rapid movement, conversion, arbitrage and risk avoidance. The realization of these functions is inseparable from the existence of a cryptocurrency with stable value. Metacoin came into being. Metacoin's positioning is not to obtain currency status, but to connect encrypted assets with physical assets. Metacoin is associated with physical assets through an integral that anchors valuable assets.

The name of the integral is Tfil. The biggest difference from ordinary integral is that it anchors specific financial assets. At present, the anchored asset of Tfil is 0.001T Filecoin HashRate, which is equivalent to 400 South Korean won at the current price. In the future, Tfil can anchor a package financial asset plan worth 400 South Korean won. The package financial asset plan will include but not limited to the most valuable encrypted assets in the future Metaverse. Because Tfil anchors the HashRate, all activated integral can obtain the mining income of Filecoin every day. Therefore, Tfil is a valuable commodity. Its value is the daily mining income. Tfil can also be understood as an electronic commodity voucher.
